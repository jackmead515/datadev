# Courses

This is a set of courses I would like to take. Unfortunately, I had to drop out
of school because I was too poor to complete it. Even after loans, I would have had to work
way to much in order to support my living. And with no support system in place, I had no
choice. BUT! That does not mean I'm going to roll over and say I'm not going to educate myself.
The internet is a beautiful thing these days. Now that I have gained financial freedom, I can
afford online classes for all sorts of fields.
