# Topics

## Directed

Directed graphs are graphs where the edges have a direction associated with them. For example, a directed edge could be used to represent a one-way street.

## Undirected

Undirected graphs are graphs where the edges do not have a direction associated with them. For example, an undirected edge could be used to represent a two-way street.

## Weighted

Weighted graphs are graphs where the edges have a weight associated with them. For example, a weighted edge could be used to represent the distance between two cities.

## Unweighted

Unweighted graphs are graphs where the edges do not have a weight associated with them. For example, an unweighted edge could be used to represent that two cities are connected.

## Cyclic

Cyclic graphs are graphs that contain cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of edges that starts and ends at the same vertex.

## Acyclic

Acyclic graphs are graphs that do not contain cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of edges that starts and ends at the same vertex.

## Sparse

Sparse graphs are graphs that have relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices.
Social networks are an example of sparse graphs.

## Dense

Dense graphs are graphs that have relatively many edges compared to the number of vertices.
Neural networks are an example of dense graphs.

## Fully Connected

Fully connected graphs are graphs where all vertices are connected to all other vertices.

## Strongly Connected

Strongly connected graphs are directed graphs where every vertex can reach every other vertex.
There may be multiple SCCs in a single graph.

## Bridges

Bridges are edges in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components.
They represent the critical connections within a graph.
